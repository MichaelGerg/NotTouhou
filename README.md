## Not Touhou

This project will take on the task of achieving a web-based Touhou game, a product not currently available. Touhou games and games looking to replicate the series are currently primarily offered on mobile devices or as Windows-only applications, so our goal will be to provide an online version of Touhou that will be accessible to all devices.

### Target Audience 

Currently, there are no popular web-based Touhou games, as the Touhou franchise primarily exists as Windows applications or (deprecated) Flash games. Thus, our audience is the fanbase of Touhou games and other similar “bullet hell” games who want a non-flash, cross-platform alternative.

### Project Abstract

“Bullet hell” games are fast-paced, reflexive games that involve maneuvering and shooting in order to survive as long as possible against barrages of projectiles and enemies that cover a majority of the play area. Our main goal will be to create a game of this genre that emulates the popular Touhou series. “Not Touhou” will look to not only accurately recreate the vastly successful gameplay of the original Touhou series, but also add a few new features to improve player experience. 

These additional features include a leaderboard system of high scores, as well as a replay system that will be able to provide a full reenactment of a playthrough. These replays will be saved on Google Drive and can be downloaded and viewed by other users. Replays and leaderboards will be linked to an account. In later iterations, we will also introduce an online co-op mode where users can play together to defeat more difficult enemies.

### Competitive Analysis

Not only will users be able to enjoy a web-based Touhou experience that isn’t currently available in the market, but “Not Touhou” will also provide a myriad of additional services.The competitors are current web based Touhou games, all of which use the deprecated Flash platform. We plan to have the ability to save replays, a co-op feature, a universal high scores system, and a message board - all features that competitors lack.

### Customer Needs

If the customer has an insatiable thirst for Touhou games and wants to feel a sense of achievement for being the best Touhou player then this web app is for them. Users will gain experience points on their profile via playing and the amount of views their replays garner. Although they will initially be able to only store 5 replays, they will be able to increase the number of replays that can be stored, as well as possibly gain banners according to their level.
