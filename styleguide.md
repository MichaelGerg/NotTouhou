# Basic Style Guide
Will be updated as people push code that gives me OCD.

### General
Tabs, not spaces (except where stated otherwise). Align line wraps with spaces if need be. Braces on the same line.

### JS
Nothing JS-specific yet.
	
### CSS
Nothing CSS-specific yet.

### HTML
Lowercase tags. `<div>`, not `<DIV>`
Generally, indent for every subtag. Exceptions for deep nesting of tags or where not indenting is more readable. Not indenting `<head>` or `<body>` is also fine.

### Ruby
Two spaces per tab.

### Commits
Commit messages take verb form i.e.
 - `add style guide`
 - `fix <some bug>`
 - `add <some feature>`
